You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The first type of loop we will learn is called a while loop because it runs while a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.

const ourArray = [];
let i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
In the code example above, the while loop will execute 5 times and append the numbers 0 through 4 to ourArray.

Let's try getting a while loop to work by pushing values to an array.

Add the numbers 5 through 0 (inclusive) in descending order to myArray using a while loop.

  //*************************************************************

  SOLUTION:

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 5;

while(i >= 0) {
  myArray.push(i);
  i--;
}

// Only change code below this line
